//Average4.java is held within the exampoles folder
//Scanner is used so that the user running the program can manually input 4 numbers when the program runs
//5 Floats are initialized n1, n2, n3, n4, and average 
// Each of the Floats are initialized by designating with a capital 'F' at the and of the initialized value
// The program prints to screen strings prompting the user to input 4 numbers
// average is set up to calculate the average of the 4 numbers that the user inputs. Parentheses are essential to ensure order of operations
// Scanner is closed to ensure that the method is closed out before the program stops running
